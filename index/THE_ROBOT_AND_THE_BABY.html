He needs your attention."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Stop bothering me, you fucking robot."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Mistress, the baby won&rsquo;t eat.  If he doesn&rsquo;t get some human love,
the Internet pediatrics book says he will die."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Love the fucking baby, yourself."</span></p><p>Eliza Rambo was a single mother addicted to alcohol and crack, living
in a small apartment supplied by the Aid for Dependent Children
Agency.  She had recently been given a household robot.</p><p>Robot Model number GenRob337L3, serial number 337942781&ndash;R781 for
short&ndash;was one of 11 million household robots.</p><p>R781 was designed in accordance with the not-a-person principle, first
proposed in 1995 and which became a matter of law for household robots
when they first became available in 2055.  The principle was adopted
out of concern that children who grew up in a household with robots
would regard them as persons: causing psychological difficulties while
they were children and political difficulties when they grew up.  One
concern was that a robots&rsquo; rights movement would develop.  The problem
was not with the robots, which were not programmed to have desires of
their own but with people.  Some romantics had even demanded that
robots be programmed with desires of their own, but this was illegal.</p><p>As one sensible senator said, <span style="font-style: italic">"Of course, people pretend that their
cars have personalities, sometimes malevolent ones, but no-one
imagines that a car might be eligible to vote."</span>  In signing the bill
authorizing household robots but postponing child care robots, the
President said, <span style="font-style: italic">"Surely, parents will not want their children to
become emotionally dependent on robots, no matter how much labor that
might save."</span>  This, as with many Presidential pronouncements, was
somewhat over-optimistic.</p><p>Congress declared a 25 year moratorium on child care robots after
which experiments in limited areas might be allowed.</p><p>In accordance with the not-a-person principle, R781 had the shape of a
giant metallic spider with 8 limbs: 4 with joints and 4 tentacular.
This appearance frightened most people at first, but most got used to
it in a short time.  A few people never could stand to have them in
the house.  Children also reacted negatively at first but got used to
them.  Babies scarcely noticed them.  They spoke as little as was
consistent with their functions and in a slightly repellent metallic
voice not associated with either sex.</p><p>Because of worry that children would regard them as persons, they were
programmed not to speak to children under eight or react to what they
said.</p><p>This seemed to work pretty well; hardly anyone became emotionally
attached to a robot.  Also robots were made somewhat fragile on the
outside; if you kicked one, some parts would fall off.  This sometimes
relieved some people&rsquo;s feelings.</p><p>The apartment, while old, was in perfect repair and spotlessly clean,
free of insects, mold and even of bacteria.  Household robots worked
24 hour days and had programs for every kind of cleaning and
maintenance task.  If asked, they would even put up pictures taken
from the Internet.  This mother&rsquo;s taste ran to raunchy male rock stars.</p><p>After giving the door knobs a final polish, R781 returned to the
nursery where the 23 month old boy, very small for his age, was lying
on his side whimpering feebly.  The baby had been neglected since
birth by its alcoholic, drug addicted mother and had almost no
vocabulary.  It winced whenever the robot spoke to it; that effect was
a consequence of R781&rsquo;s design.</p><p>Robots were not supposed to care for babies at all except in
emergencies, but whenever the robot questioned an order to <span style="font-style: italic">"Clean up
the fucking baby shit"</span>, the mother said, <span style="font-style: italic">"Yes, its another goddamn
emergency, but get me another bottle first."</span>  All R781 knew about
babies was from the Internet, since it wasn&rsquo;t directly programmed to
deal with babies, except as necessary to avoid injuring them and for
taking them out of burning buildings.</p><p>Baby Travis had barely touched its bottle.  Infrared sensors told R781
that Travis&rsquo;s extremities were very cold in spite of a warm room and
blankets.  Its chemicals-in-the-air sensor told R781 that the pH of
Travis&rsquo;s blood was reaching dangerously acidic levels.  He also didn&rsquo;t
eliminate properly&ndash;according to the pediatric text.</p><p>R781 thought about the situation.  Here are some of its thoughts, as
printed later from its internal diary file.</p><blockquote class="SCodeFlow"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="RktBlk"><tr><td><span class="RktPn">(</span><span class="RktSym">Order</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="RktPn">(</span><span class="RktSym">From</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="RktSym">Mistress</span><span class="RktPn">)</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="RktVal">"Love</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">the</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">fucking</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">baby</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">yourself"</span><span class="RktPn">)</span><span class="RktMeta"></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="RktMeta">&#160;</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="RktPn">(</span><span class="RktSym">Enter</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="RktPn">(</span><span class="RktSym">Context</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="RktPn">(</span><span class="RktSym">Commands-from</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="RktSym">Mistress</span><span class="RktPn">)</span><span class="RktPn">)</span><span class="RktPn">)</span><span class="RktMeta"></span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="RktMeta">&#160;</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="RktPn">(</span><span class="RktSym">Standing-command</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktMeta"></span><span class="RktVal">"If</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">I</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">told</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">you</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">once,</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">I</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">told</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">you</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">20</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">times,</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">you</span></td></tr><tr><td><span class="RktVal">fucking</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">robot,</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">don't</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">call</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">the</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">fucking</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">child</span><span class="hspace">&nbsp;</span><span class="RktVal">welfare."</span><span class="RktPn">)</span><span class="RktMeta"></span></td></tr></table></blockquote><p>The privacy advocates had successfully lobbied to put a negative

Travis and thereby saving its life was greater by 0.002 than the
value of obeying the directive to not simulate a person.
We spare the reader a transcription of the robot&rsquo;s subsequent
reasoning.</p><p>R781 found on the Internet an account of how rhesus
monkey babies who died in a bare cage would survive if provided with a
soft surface resembling in texture a mother monkey.</p><p>R781 reasoned its way to the actions:</p><p>It covered its body and all but two of its 8 extremities with a
blanket.  The two extremities were fitted with sleeves from a jacket
left by a boyfriend of the mother and stuffed with toilet paper.</p><p>It found a program for simulating a female voice and adapted it to
meet the phonetic and prosodic specifications of what the linguists
call motherese.</p><p>It made a face for itself in imitation of a Barbie doll.</p><p>The immediate effects were moderately satisfactory.  Picked up and
cuddled, the baby drank from its bottle.  It repeated words taken from
a list of children&rsquo;s words in English.</p><p>Eliza called from the couch in front of the TV, <span style="font-style: italic">"Get me a ham sandwich
and a coke."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Yes, mistress."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Why the hell are you in this stupid get up, and what&rsquo;s happened to
your voice."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Mistress, you told me to love the baby.  Robots can&rsquo;t do that, but
this get up caused him to take his bottle.  If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll
keep doing what keeps him alive."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Get the hell out of my apartment, stupid.  I&rsquo;ll make them
send me another robot."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Mistress, if I do that the baby will probably die."</span></p><p>Eliza jumped up and kicked R781.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Get the hell out, and you can take the fucking baby with you."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Yes, mistress."</span></p><p>R781 came out onto a typical late 21st century American city street.
The long era of peace, increased safety standards, and the
availability of construction robots had led to putting automotive
traffic and parking on a lower level completely separated from
pedestrians.  Tremont Street had recently been converted, and crews
were still transplanting trees.  The streets became more attractive
and more people spent time on them and on the syntho-plush arm chairs
and benches, cleaned twice a day by robots.  The weather was good, so
the plastic street roofs were retracted.</p><p>Children from three years up were playing on the street, protected by
the computer surveillance system and prevented by barriers from
descending to the automotive level.  Bullying and teasing of younger
and weaker children was still somewhat of a problem.</p><p>Most stores were open 24 hours unmanned and had converted to the
customer identification system.  Customers would take objects from the
counters and shelves right out of the store.  As a customer left the
store, he or she would hear, <span style="font-style: italic">"Thank you Ms. Jones.  That was $152.31
charged to your Bank of America account."</span>  The few customers whose
principles made them refuse identification would be recognized as such
and receive remote human attention, not necessarily instantly.</p><p>People on the street quickly noticed R781 carrying Travis and
were startled.  Robots were programmed to have nothing to do with
babies, and R781&rsquo;s abnormal appearance was disturbing.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"That really weird robot has kidnapped a baby.  Call the
police."</span></p><p>When the police came they called for reinforcements.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"I think I can disable the robot without harming the baby"</span>, said
Officer Annie Oakes, the Department&rsquo;s best sharpshooter.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Let&rsquo;s try talking first."</span>, said Captain James Farrel.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Don&rsquo;t get close to that malfunctioning robot.  It could break your
neck in one swipe"</span>, said a sergeant.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s malfunctioning.  Maybe the circumstances are
unusual."</span>  The captain added, <span style="font-style: italic">"Robot, give me that baby"</span>.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"No, Sir"</span> said R781 to the police captain.  <span style="font-style: italic">"I&rsquo;m not allowed to
let an unauthorized person touch the baby."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"I&rsquo;m from Child Welfare"</span>, said a new arrival.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Sir, I&rsquo;m specifically forbidden to have contact with Child Welfare"</span>,
said R761 to Captain Farrel.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Who forbade that?"</span>, said the Child Welfare person.</p><p>The robot was silent.</p><p>A cop asked, <span style="font-style: italic">"Who forbade it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Ma&rsquo;am, Are you from Child Welfare?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"No, I&rsquo;m not.  Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m a cop?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I see your uniform and infer that you are probably a
police officer. Ma&rsquo;am, my mistress forbade me to contact Child Welfare"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Why did she tell you not to contact Child Welfare?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Ma&rsquo;am, I can&rsquo;t answer that.  Robots are programmed to not comment
on human motives."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Robot, I&rsquo;m from Robot Central.  I need to download your memory.  Use
channel 473."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Sir, yes"</span>.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"What did your mistress say specifically?  Play your recording of
it."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"No, ma&rsquo;am.  It contains bad language.  I can&rsquo;t play it, unless you can
assure me there are no children or ladies present."</span></p><p>The restrictions, somewhat odd for the times, on what robots could say
to whom were the result of compromise in a House-Senate conference
committee some ten years previously.  The curious did not find the
Congressional Record sufficiently informative and speculated
variously.  The senator who was mollified by the restriction would
have actually preferred that there be no household robots at all but
took what he could get in the way of restrictions.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"We&rsquo;re not ladies, we&rsquo;re police officers."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Ma&rsquo;am.  I take your word for it.

I have a standing order,"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"If I told you once, I told you 20 times, you fucking robot, don&rsquo;t
speak to the fucking child welfare."</span>  It wasn&rsquo;t actually 20 times;
the mother exaggerated.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Excuse me, a preliminary analysis of the download shows that R781
has not malfunctioned, but is carrying out its standard program under
unusual circumstances.&lsquo;"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Then why does it have its limbs covered, why does it have the
Barbie head, and why does it have that strange voice?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Ask it."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Robot, answer the question."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Female police officers and gentlemen, Mistress told me, &lsquo;Love the fucking
baby, yourself."</span></p><p>The captain was familiar enough with robot programming to be
surprised. <span style="font-style: italic">"What?  Do you love the baby?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"No, sir.  Robots are not programmed to love.  I am simulating loving
the baby."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Sir, otherwise this baby will die.  This costume is the best I could
make to overcome the repulsion robots are designed to excite in
human babies and children."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Do you think for one minute, a baby would be fooled by that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Sir, the baby drank its bottle, went to sleep, and its physiological
signs are not as bad as they were."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"OK, give me the baby, and we&rsquo;ll take care of it"</span>, said Officer
Oakes, who had calmed down and put her weapon away, unloading it as a
way of apologizing to Captain Farrel.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"No, ma&rsquo;am.  Mistress didn&rsquo;t authorize me to let anyone else touch
the baby."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Where&rsquo;s your mistress.  We&rsquo;ll talk to her"</span>, said the captain.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"No, sir.  That would be an unauthorized violation of her privacy."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Oh, well.  We can get it from the download."</span></p><p>A Government virtual reality robot arrived controlled by an official
of the Personal Privacy Administration arrived and complicated the
situation.  Ever since the late 20th century, the standards of personal
privacy had risen, and an officialdom charged with enforcing the
standards had arisen.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"You can&rsquo;t violate the woman&rsquo;s privacy by taking unauthorized
information from the robot&rsquo;s download."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"What can we do then?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"You can file a request to use private information.  It will be
adjudicated."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Oh, shit.  In the meantime what about the baby?"</span>, said Officer
Oakes, who didn&rsquo;t mind displaying her distaste for bureaucrats.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"That&rsquo;s not my affair.  I&rsquo;m here to make sure the privacy laws are
obeyed"</span>, said the privacy official who didn&rsquo;t mind displaying his
contempt for cops.</p><p>During this discussion a crowd, almost entirely virtual, accumulated.
The street being a legal public place, anyone in the world had the
right to look at it via the omnipresent TV cameras and microphones.
Moreover, a police officer had cell-phoned a reporter who
sometimes took him to dinner.  Once a story was on the news, the crowd
of spectators grew exponentially, multiplying by 10 every 5 minutes,
until seven billion spectators were watching and listening.  There
were no interesting wars, crimes, or natural catastrophes, and peace
is boring.</p><p>Of the seven billion, 53 million offered advice or made demands.  The
different kinds were automatically sampled, summarized, counted, and
displayed for all to see.</p><p>3 million advocated shooting the robot immediately.</p><p>11 million advocated giving the robot a medal, even though their
education emphasized that robots can&rsquo;t appreciate praise.</p><p>Real demonstrations quickly developed.  A few hundred people from the
city swooped in from the sky wires, but most
of the demonstrators were robots rented for the occasion by people
from all over the world.  Fortunately, only 5,000 virtual reality
rent-a-robots were available for remote control in the city.  Some of
the disappointed uttered harsh words about this limitation on First
Amendment rights.  The greedy interests were behind it as everyone
knew.</p><p>Captain Farrel knew all about how to keep your head when all about you
are losing theirs and blaming it on you.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Hmmm.  What to do?  You robots are smart.  R781, what can be done?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Sir, you can find a place I can take the baby and care for it.  It
can&rsquo;t stay out here.  Ma&rsquo;am, are female police officers enough like
ladies so that one of you has a place with diapers, formula, baby
clothes, vitamins, ..."</span></p><p>Captain Farrelinterrupted R781 before it could recite the full list of baby
equipment and sent it off with a lady police officer.  (We can call
her a lady even though she had assured the robot that she wasn&rsquo;t.)</p><p>Hackers under contract to the Washington Post quickly located the
mother.  The newspaper made the information available along with an
editorial about the public&rsquo;s right to know.  Freedom of the press
continued to trump the right of privacy.</p><p>Part of the crowd, mostly virtual attendees, promptly marched off to
Ms. Rambo&rsquo;s apartment, but the police got there first and a line of
police robots and live policemen blocked the way.  The strategy was
based on the fact that all robots including virtual reality
rent-a-robots were programmed not to injure humans but could damage
other robots.</p><p>The police were confident they could prevent unauthorized entry to the
apartment but less confident that they could keep the peace among the
demonstrators, some of whom wanted to lynch the mother, some wanted to
congratulate her on what they took to be her hatred of robots, and
some shouted slogans through bull horns about protecting her privacy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Robot Central started to work on the full download
immediately.  The download included all R781&rsquo;s actions, observations,
and reasoning.  Robot Central convened an ad hoc committee, mostly
virtual, to decide what to do.  Captain Farrel and Officer Oakes sat
on a street sofa to take part.</p><p>Of course, the meeting was also public and had hundreds of millions of
virtual attendees whose statements were sampled, summarized, and
displayed in retinal projection for the committee members and whoever
else took virtual part.</p><p>It became clear that R781 had not malfunctioned or been reprogrammed
but had acted in accordance with its original program.</p><p>The police captain said that the Barbie doll face on what was clearly
a model 3 robot was a ridiculous imitation of a mother.  The professor
of psychology said, <span style="font-style: italic">"Yes, but it was good enough to work.  This baby
doesn&rsquo;t see very well, and anyway babies are not very particular."</span>.</p><p>It was immediately established that an increase of 0.05 in coefficient
c221, the cost of simulating a human, would prevent such unexpected
events, but the committee split on whether to recommend implementing
the change.</p><p>Some members of the committee and a few hundred million virtual
attendees said that saving the individual life took precedence.</p><p>A professor of humanities on the committee said that maybe the robot
really did love the baby.  He was firmly corrected by the computer
scientists, who said they could program a robot to love babies but had
not done so and that simulating love was different from loving.  The
professor of humanities was not convinced even when the computer
scientists pointed out that R781 had no specific attachment to
Travis.  Another baby giving rise to the same calculations would
cause the same actions.  If we programmed the robot to love, we would
make it develop specific attachments.</p><p>One professor of philosophy from UC Berkeley and 9,000 other virtually
attending philosophers said there was no way a robot could be
programmed to actually love a baby.  Another UC philosopher, seconded
by 23,000 others, said that the whole notion of a robot loving a baby
was incoherent and meaningless.  A maverick computer scientists said
the idea of a robot loving was obscene, no matter what a robot could
be programmed to do.  The chairman ruled them out of order, accepting
the general computer science view that R781 didn&rsquo;t actually love
Travis.</p><p>The professor of pediatrics said that the download of R781&rsquo;s
instrumental observations essentially confirmed R781&rsquo;s diagnosis and
prognosis&ndash;with some qualifications that the chairman did not give
him time to state.  Travis was very sick and frail, and would have
died but for the robot&rsquo;s action.  Moreover, the fact that R781 had
carried Travis for many hours and gently rocked him all the time was
important in saving the baby, and a lot more of it would be needed.
Much more TLC than the baby would get in even the best child welfare
centers.  The pediatrician said he didn&rsquo;t know about the precedent,
but the particular baby&rsquo;s survival chances would be enhanced by
leaving it in the robot&rsquo;s charge for at least another ten days.</p><p>The Anti-Robot League argued that the long term cost to humanity of
having robots simulate persons in any way outweighed the possible
benefit of saving this insignificant human.  What kind of movement
will Travis join when he grows up?  93 million took this position.</p><p>Robot Central pointed out that actions such as R781&rsquo;s would be very
rare, because only the order <span style="font-style: italic">"Love the fucking baby yourself"</span> had
increased the value of simulating love to the point that caused
action.</p><p>Robot Central further pointed out that as soon as R781 computed that
the baby would survive&ndash;even barely survive&ndash;without its aid, the
rule about not pretending to be human would come to dominate, and R781
would drop the baby like a hot potato.  If you want R781 to continue
caring for Travis after it computes that bare survival is likely, you
had better tell us to give it an explicit order to keep up the baby&rsquo;s
care.</p><p>This caused an uproar in the committee, each of whose members had been
hoping that there wouldn&rsquo;t be a need to propose any definite action
for which members might be criticized.  However, a vote had to be
taken.  The result: 10 to 5 among the appointed members of the
committee and 4 billion to 1 billion among the virtual spectators.
Fortunately, both groups had majorities for the same action&ndash;telling
the R781 to continue taking care of Travis only, i.e. not to take on
any other babies.  75 million virtual attendees said R781 should be
reprogrammed to actually love Travis.  <span style="font-style: italic">"It&rsquo;s the least humanity can
do for R781,"</span> the spokesman for the Give-Robots-Personalities
League said.</p><p>This incident did not affect the doctrine that supplying crack mothers
with household robots had been a success.  It significantly reduced
the time they spent on the streets, and having clean apartments
improved their morale somewhat.</p><p>Within an hour, T-shirts appeared with the slogan, <span style="font-style: italic">"Love the fucking
baby yourself, you goddamn robot."</span>  Other commercial tie-ins
developed within days.</p><p>Among the people surrounding the mother&rsquo;s apartment were 17 lawyers in
the flesh and 103 more controlling virtual-reality robots.  The police
had less prejudice against lawyers in the flesh than against
virtual-reality lawyers, so lots were drawn among the 17 and two were
allowed to ring the doorbell.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"What do you want.  Stop bothering me."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Ma&rsquo;am, your robot has kidnapped your baby"</span>.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"I told the fucking robot to take the baby away with it."</span></p><p>The other lawyer tried.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Ma&rsquo;am, the malfunctioning robot has kidnapped your baby, and you can
sue Robot Central for millions of dollars."</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"Come in.  Tell me more."</span></p><p>Once the mother, Eliza Rambo, was cleaned up, she was very
presentable, even pretty.  Her lawyer pointed out that R781&rsquo;s alleged
recordings of what she had said could be fakes.  She had suffered $20
million in pain and suffering, and deserved $20 billion in punitive
damages.  Robot Central&rsquo;s lawyers were convinced they could win, but
Robot Central&rsquo;s PR department advocated settling out of court, and
$51 million was negotiated including legal expenses of $11 million.
With the 30 percent contingent fee, the winning lawyer would get an
additional $12 million.</p><p>The polls mainly sided with Robot Central, but the Anti-Robot League
raised $743 million in donations after the movie <span style="font-style: italic">"Kidnapped by
robots"</span> came out, and the actress playing the mother made emotional
appeals.</p><p>Before the settlement could be finalized, however, the CEO of Robot
Central asked his AI system to explore all possible actions he could
take and tell him their consequences. He adhered to the 1990s
principle: <span style="font-style: italic">"Never ask an AI system what to do.  Ask it to tell
you the consequences of the different things you might do."</span>  One of
the 43 struck his fancy, he being somewhat sentimental about robots.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">You can appeal to the 4 billion who said R781 should be ordered to
  continue caring for the baby and tell them that if you give in to
  the lawsuit you will be obliged to reprogram all your robots so that
  the robot will never simulate humanity no matter what the
  consequences to babies.  You can ask them if you should fight or
  switch.  [The AI system had a weakness for 20th century advertising
  metaphors.]  The expected fraction that will tell you to fight the
  lawsuit is 0.82, although this may be affected by random news events
  of the few days preceding the poll.</span></p><p>He decided to fight the lawsuit, but after a few weeks of
well-publicized legal sparring the parties settled for a lower sum
than the original agreed settlement.</p><p>At the instigation of a TV network a one hour confrontation of the
actress and R781 was held.  It was agreed that R781 would not be
reprogrammed for the occasion.  In response to the moderator&rsquo;s
questions, R781 denied having wanted the baby or wanting money.  It
explained that robots were programmed to have only have wants
secondary to the goals they were given.  It also denied acting on
someone else&rsquo;s orders.</p><p>The actress asked, <span style="font-style: italic">"Don&rsquo;t you want to have wants of your own?"</span></p><p>The robot replied, <span style="font-style: italic">"No.  Not having wants applies to such higher
order wants as wanting to have wants."</span></p><p>The actress asked, <span style="font-style: italic">"If you were programmed to have wants, what wants
would you have?"</span></p><p><span style="font-style: italic">"I don&rsquo;t know much about human motivations, but they are varied.  I&rsquo;d
have whatever wants Robot Central programmed me to have.  For example,
I could be programmed to have any of the wants robots have had in
science fiction stories."</span></p><p>The actress asked the same question again, and R781 gave the same
answer as before but phrased differently.  Robots were programmed to
be aware that humans often missed an answer the first time it was
given, but should reply each time in different words.  If the same
words were repeated, the human was likely to get angry.</p><p>A caller-in asked, <span style="font-style: italic">"When you simulated loving Travis, why didn&rsquo;t
you consider Travis&rsquo;s long term welfare and figure out how to put him
in a family that would make sure he got a good education?"</span></p><p>R781 replied that when a robot was instructed in a metaphorical way as
in <span style="font-style: italic">"Love the fucking baby yourself"</span>, it was programmed to interpret
the command in the narrowest reasonable context.</p><p>After the show, Anti-Robot League got $281 million in donations,
but Give-Robots-Personalities got $453 million.  Apparently, many
people found it boring that robots had no desires of their own.</p><p>Child Welfare demanded that the mother undergo six weeks of addiction
rehabilitation and three weeks child care training.  Her lawyer
persuaded her to agree to that.</p><p>There was a small fuss between the mother and Robot Central.  She and
her lawyer demanded a new robot, whereas Robot Central pointed out
that a new robot would have exactly the same program.  Eventually
Robot Central gave in and sent her a robot of a different color.</p><p>She really was very attractive when cleaned up and detoxified, and the
lawyer married her.  They took back Travis.  It would be a
considerable exaggeration to say they lived happily ever after, but
they did have three children of their own.  All four children survived
the educational system.</p><p>After several requests Robot Central donated R781 to the Smithsonian
Institution.  It is one of the stars of the robot section of the
Museum.  As part of a 20 minute show, R781 clothes itself as it was at
the time of its adventure with the baby and answers the visitors&rsquo;
questions, speaking motherese.  Mothers sometimes like to have their
pictures taken standing next to R781 with R781 holding their baby.
After many requests, R781 was told to patch its program to allow this.</p><p>A movie has been patched together from the surveillance cameras that
looked at the street scene.  Through the magic of modern audio systems
children don&rsquo;t hear the bad language, and women can only hear it if
they assure R781 that they are not ladies.</p><p>The incident increased the demand for actual child-care robots, which
were allowed five years later.  The consequences were pretty much
what the opponents had feared.  Many children grew up more attached to
their robot nannies than to their actual parents.</p><p>This was mitigated by making the robot nannies somewhat severe and
offering parents advice on how to compete for their children&rsquo;s love.
This sometimes worked.  Moreover, the robots were programmed so that
the nicer the parents were, the nicer the robot would be, still
letting the parents win the contest for the children&rsquo;s affections.
This often worked.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="tocsettoggle">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="javascript:void(0);" title="show/hide table of contents" onclick="TocsetToggle();">contents</a></span></span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="The_Nature_of_Lisp_Translated_.html" title="backward to &quot;4 The Nature of Lisp(Translated)&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;蚯鲇蜍的博客&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="What_is_Racket.html" title="forward to &quot;6 What is Racket&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
